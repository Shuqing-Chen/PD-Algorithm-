# PD-Algorithm-
The repository intends to share and find out the limitations of Product Difference algorithm, which is used in various cases. Here the algorithm is used to get initial values of weights and abscissa's from initial Moments, for the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments(DQMOM) used to implement Population Balance Equation(PBE) in Fluidity
